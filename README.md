## Homework 5 â€“ Background Tasks & Notifications
### Nikolai Frank Nilsen

The AnnoyingEx app demonstrates basic WorkManager and Notification functionality to manage incoming messages from a fictional ex, even in the background. Tapping the "Here we go again..." button begins creating a notification containing a message every 20 minutes only when the phone is charging. Tapping the "Block" button stops this process.
